Changes for Perl extension Aspect-Library-Profiler

0.32 Thu Jan  7 2010 - Adam Kennedy
     - Split into separate distribution for dependency reasons
       (The need for Benchmark:: modules blocked installation of the main
       Aspect package on some platforms)

0.15 Thu Jul 24 23:02:11 CEST 2008 (Marcel Gruenauer <marcel@cpan.org>)
     - fixed version in all modules. *sigh*

0.14 Thu Jul 24 22:46:43 CEST 2008 (Marcel Gruenauer <marcel@cpan.org>)
     - fixed dist style

0.13 Thu Jul 24 18:22:15 CEST 2008 (Marcel Gruenauer <marcel@cpan.org>)
     - Made sure every module has a $VERSION
     - updated MANIFEST and MANIFEST.SKIP
     - removed META.yml as it is being generated by Module::Install
     - added requirements to Makefile.PL
     - converted Makefile.PL to use Module::Install
     - Aspect::Hook::LexWrap now uses warnings and strict; some changes were
       necessary for those to go through
     - fixed POD error in Aspect::Modular
     - added spaces where necessary to avoid having the template's start_tag in
       the code
     - renamed t/all_tests.t to t/01_all.t
     - added t/perlcriticrc
     - added .shipit
     - set version to 0.13
     - updated MANIFEST
     - updated t/perlcriticrc

0.12 Sat, 24 Mar 2007 00:00:00 +0100 (Ran Eilam <ran.eilam@gmail.com>)
     - You can now attach advice to subs in main:: package, see Advice tests
     - Made everything easier to install by including dependencies required for
       testing
     - Added __always_fire option to Listenable
     - Listenable: You can now let listeners receive any parameters, not just
       the event, see the test object_listener
     - Modified our hack on Hook::LexWrap so it does not ignore prototypes, see
       Advice tests
     - Removed old warning from Makefile.PL

0.11 Tue, 03 Aug 2004 00:00:00 +0100 (Ran Eilam <ran.eilam@gmail.com>)
     - Fixed problem in upgrading from 0.08, CPAN.pm was getting confused on
       Advice and Modular, because they had no version numbers, and undef is
       smaller than 0.08. (merlyn)
     - Lowered dependency on Test::Class to 0.03

0.10 Fri, 30 Jul 2004 00:00:00 +0100 (Ran Eilam <ran.eilam@gmail.com>)
     - No longer a developer release
     - Added Listenable reusable aspect
     - Added subject_params() support for TestClass library aspect

0.09_03 Tue, 06 Jul 2004 00:00:00 +0100 (Ran Eilam <ran.eilam@gmail.com>)
     - Added Carp::Heavy to list of untouchables in Weaver.pm, to avoid Carp
       dumping core
     - Test::Class aspect allows for customizing IUT through init_subject_state

0.09_02 Sat, 06 Mar 2004 00:00:00 +0100 (Ran Eilam <ran.eilam@gmail.com>)
     - AdviceContext now has the original code, so you can do AspectJ-style
       around advice. You can call the original code from before or after
       advice. Added AdviceContext::run_original.
     - Memoize can memoize in any context, not just scalar, again
     - Added Test::Class helper aspect
     - Started using Devel::Symdump

0.09_01 Sat, 06 Mar 2004 00:00:00 +0100 (Ran Eilam <ran.eilam@gmail.com>)
     - Released for review by participants in YAPC::Israel 2004
     - New syntax is incompatible with old
     - New maintainer, Ran Eilam
     - Control flow pointcut: cflow(), done according to Marcel's design
     - Advice context trapping for control flow pointcuts
     - Use Test::Class for unit tests
     - Wormhole reusable aspect
     - Added prototypes so you can dispense with parentheses
     - Removed return/around pointcuts, added after advice
     - Removed attribute interface
     - Added a mutated version of Hook::LexWrap with support for
       appending/removing arguments
     - Moved reusable aspects to Aspect::Library
     - regression: Aspect exported subs generate join points again

0.07 Wed, 31 Jul 2002 22:42:27 +0200 (Marcel Gruenauer <marcel@cpan.org>)
     - The distribution has been adapted for use with perl5.8.0.
       C<Hook::LexWrap> is now a core module, but there was a problem with
       context (wantarray) handling with Aspect::Memoize. Sorry about the perl
       5.6.x users, but this is bleeding-edge stuff, so you're expected to use
       the very latest gear. Anyway, you can still get an earlier version (up
       to 0.07) from CPAN, which will work with perl 5.6.x.
     - Aspect::Memoize is now intended for subroutines returning scalars only.
       That is, if the sub is called in list context, it will still only
       memoize, and return, a memoized scalar. Void context obviously doesn't
       matter when it comes to memoization; subroutines returning lists are
       something I have to think about.
     - Tests now use Test::More

0.07 Fri, 15 Mar 2002 09:04:51 +0100 (Marcel Gruenauer <marcel@cpan.org>)
     - symbols exported from Aspect.pm now don't generate join points. So I
       added Aspect::import() and modified Aspect::JoinPoint::enum() to check
       for %Aspect::exp_syms.

0.06 Fri, 26 Oct 2001 16:42:51 +0200 (Marcel Gruenauer <marcel@cpan.org>)
     - added around() function to Aspect.pm
     - added Aspect::Profiled
     - added Aspect::Attribute interface to creating advice
     - made Aspect::Advice's enable() and disable() return $self
     - added cookbook example program callflow_attr.pl
     - added cookbook recipes for bounds checking and change tracking, plus
       sample programs

0.05 Thu, 11 Oct 2001 09:44:50 +0200 (Marcel Gruenauer <marcel@cpan.org>)
     - removed dependency on Data::Denter

0.04 Mon, 01 Oct 2001 18:33:00 +0200 (Marcel Gruenauer <marcel@cpan.org>)
     - removed the patched Hook::LexWrap now that 0.20 is out which fixes all
       the problems of 0.10
     - added documentation (a recurring theme, never finishes)

0.03 Sun, 30 Sep 2001 19:43:56 +0200 (Marcel Gruenauer <marcel@cpan.org>)
     - added documentation
     - Included a patched Hook::LexWrap that fixes a bug with wantarray
       preservation in subroutine wrappers. Will be removed if and when Damian
       approves of the patch or otherwise fixes the bug.

0.02 Fri, 28 Sep 2001 12:59:06 +0200 (Marcel Gruenauer <marcel@cpan.org>)
     - added documentation
     - added '$::thisjp' global variable
     - added modular memoization aspect: Aspect::Memoize
     - added modular tracing aspect: Aspect::Trace

0.01 Fri, 28 Sep 2001 10:36:08 +0200 (Marcel Gruenauer <marcel@cpan.org>)
     - original version
