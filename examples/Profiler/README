                    Profiler Example
                    ================

An example of profiling using the profiler aspect. Requires
Benchmark::Timer. We profile all calls on SlowObject, which were made
from its method run(). Here is what a sample run should look like:

  Done with SlowObject::run
  2 trials of SlowObject::fast (0s total), 0s/trial
  1 trial of SlowObject::slow (1.021s total)
  1 trial of SlowObject::very_slow (2s total)
